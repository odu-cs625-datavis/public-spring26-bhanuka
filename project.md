# Semester Project

**Due:** Sunday, December 7 by 11:59pm

The main goal of the project is for you to apply your theoretical knowledge in a creative effort. 

to take the knowledge and background that you are learning this semester about data visualization and put it to good use in a new, creative effort. Your final deliverable will be a single, static explanatory visualization that communicates an interesting insight. In this [blog post](https://ws-dl.blogspot.com/2025/01/2025-01-06-data-visualization-class.html), Dr. Weigle has included three student projects from Fall 2024, which you may use for inspiration. 

The project has two milestones in addition to the final visualization. You will receive feedback for each milestone that can be applied to next iteration of your project. The milestones are required and will be part of your final score for the project grade. 

The final submission of your project must include the completed visualization, a demo video, and a written report for your visulization. 

As the final task, you will have to review and provide feedback on your classmates' projects. The peer review component is a part project requirements and will also count towards your final project grade. 


|milestone|main tasks|deadline|
|---|---|---|
|1|choose your topic, potential datasets, brainstorm interesting questions|Sun, Mar 01|
|2|explore data, discover interesting finding, sketch proposed final charts|Sun, Apr 05 |
|final|final chart, video, and report|Sun, May 03|
|feedback|comment/feedback on classmates' projects|Fri, May 08|

The full semester project is due Sunday, May 03 by 11:59pm.

Here are general guidelines, and I will post detailed requirements throughout the semester:

* This is an individual assignment. No group work allowed.
* You may use any tool of your choice to perform your *data cleaning and exploratory analysis*.
* If you are a Computer Science student, you must use either Python or Vega-Lite to build your final chart. Otherwise, you may use any tool of your choice to build your final chart.
* The goal is to present your findings about your chosen topic. Although you may do exploratory analysis to understand your data, your visualization should focus on showing the audience what you learned.
